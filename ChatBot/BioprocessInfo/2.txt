BIOPROCESS CONTROL STATEMENT

In the first part of this section, the most usually literature models regarding the bioprocess 
kinetic will be presented. Hence, based on a general admitted classification, different biomass 
growth and product models in addition with bioprocess parameter evolution will be analyzed and the 
conceptual limitations (if necessary) will be set up. In #2.2, the general control objectives will 
be established, with a special emphasize on the economic performance criteria. Finally, a general 
presentation on the control procedures will be made, and representative point of views will be 
shown in order to point out the state of the art in the field and the outcoming tendencies.

2. 1.  BI O PR O C E S S M O D E L I N G

The knowledge about bioprocess behavior and modes of operation (Doran, 1986; Young, Bungay, 1973), 
allows the metabolic routes considerations in view of bioprocess optimal control. If that knowledge 
is carried out in different kinetic equations, than:
-  The    bioprocess    mathematical representation can be the basis for adequate  optimization  
and  control technique  applications  (Moser,  1992; Wucherer et al., 1992);
-  The  model  provides  the  necessary information about the characteristics of the chosen 
procedure (Chen, Bastin, 1991; Bastin et al., 1992);
-  A good model synthesizes the physiology and the genetic determinations of the specified 
microorganism. Hence, this is the best technique to predict the process efficiency (Mosrati et al., 
1991).

The mathematical models, which describe the living cell evolution, must show the complex biosystem 
attributes, must be as possible extensive and non-speculative and must be based on cell's 
biochemistry (Freyer e/ al, 1989). Hence, the bioprocess model must be an  acceptable  compromise  
between  the presentation of detailed internal processes (i.e. with considerable number of 
parameters) and the consideration of a short parameter number, easy to use and estimate (Ljubenova, 
Ignatova, 1994).
|
Based on living system specificity, the bioprocesses  are characterized by non- linearity, 
multivariability and parameter time variance (Eiki, Osono, 1990; Cushing, 1991;
Stanbury, Whitaker, 1994; Kurtanjek, 1992). Consequently, the variables, which describe the 
bioprocess evolution, demonstrate a strong interdependency, which make impossible the correlative 
influences study (Turner ct al., 1988). The general equation presented below:\
is only a theoretical assumption.

The attempts to realize such global models were not successful (firstly, due to the impossibility 
to measure on-line the great number  of  bioprocess  parameters,  and secondly,  due to the high 
degree of complexity, which characterizes the cell mechanisms). The deadlock was surmounted by the 
implementation of the models depending of few variables, or by the use of the linear models for 
restricted sections (periods of time) (Stanbury, Whitaker, 1994). This last one is functionally 
taking into account that the bioprocesses are generally characterized by high time constants (hours 
or tens hours), hence, the bioprocess should be considered quasi-linear (Stanbury, Whitaker, 1994).
|
A general review of the bioprocess kinetic models was done by Moser (Moser, 1988). According to his 
classification, for the modeling of the biosystems, the deterministic models are preferred to the 
probabilistic ones. Several kinds of deterministic models were used (Moser, 1988):
-  Unstructured models   the cells are considered  as black box. In these conditions the cell 
concentration is the most important parameter and the cell, as an entity, is significantly 
influenced by the environmental conditions.
-  Structured  models  — based on the assumption  of  the  cell  structure, considered at the level 
of the main chemical components, or having in mind the cellular morphology (age, dimension, shape 
etc.).
|
From  a  point  of  view  neglecting  the recognition/omission   of   the   above
classification, Moser has proposed another classification (Moser, 1988):
-  Unsegregated (continuous, distributive) models — which consider  individual identical cells;
-  Segregated (corpuscular) models — based on individual cells consideration, but with distinctive 
features.

The segregated models are useful to describe biosystems characterized by average states. If the 
biosystem contains cells obtained after genetically modification, some characteristics are 
different from a cell group to another, and as a consequence, the correlation with the product 
formation is more complex.

The simplest and most used examples are the unstructured, unsegregated models (e.g. the Monod model 
for the microbial growth). Only structured models are able to predict the biological  phenomena  in 
 unequilibrated conditions  of  growth  (the  growth  is equilibrated for a period of time if each 
extensive property of the biosystem is proportional by increasing) (Campbell, 1977). The Monod 
model is applied only for the biosystems with equilibrated growth (e.g. the exponential growth in 
batch cultures and the steady state phase in continuous cultivation).
|
The postulates defined by Edwards and Wilke (Edwards, Wilke, 1968) in the 
bioprocess-modeling domain establish the biological kinetic norms; hence, a biological model:
-  Must be able to represent all culture phases;
-  Must be enough flexible to approximate different data types without the insertion of significant 
distortions;
-  Each model parameter must have a physic significance;
-  Must be continuously derivable;
-  The parameters must be easy to evaluate;
-  The model must be easy to operate, once the parameters evaluated.
|
2.1.1.  Unstructured  and unsegregated models

Conforming  to the  scientific  literature (Kossen, Oosterhuis, 1985), an unstructured model can be 
conceived as black box and the structured one as gray box. A gray box is build as a black box 
gathering in addition with their relationships, which define the biosystem structure. The 
unstructured mathematical models can be:
-  Constitutive equations:
-  Kinetic equations.
-  Transport equations.
-  Thermodynamic equations.
-  Balance equations (stoichiometry)
|
2.1.1.1. Balance equations

The balance equations were utilized (Cooney et af. 1977) to design an algorithm to keep up the 
monitoring of bioprocess performance indicators. The main parameters X,  xis and x/o  were  
determined  using  the stoichyometric relationship relating to product formation and growth and by 
the continuous monitoring of the oxygen flow rate, OUR, CPR and of the carbon and natrium source 
consumption. The estimation algorithm was tested  on  a  batch  process  of  yeast (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) growth using
glucose substrate.

Through the next step, the proposed algorithm was used for optimal control of the feed rate in a 
fed-batch bioprocess in order to increase the substrate consumption yield ( x s'  0,5) and to 
maintain a high value of the cell mass productivity (dX/dt = max).
|
There are also some models, which utilize the substrate concentration in more complex structures. 
Hence, Verhoff (Verhoff et al., 1972), introduces two steps in the cell behavior: assimilation and 
ingestion, but the resulting equation is too complex. Moreover, Nyholm (Nyholm, 1976), introduces a 
dual function for substrate utilization: consumption (including assimilation and desassimilation in 
the liquid phase) and growth (substrate utilization for growth)
|
Conforming to literature references, the Monod kinetic slowly tills to the asymptotic value; i.e. 
it fit not well the experimental data,
This kinetic model has a practical application in the wastewater treatment field.

One of the most important objectives for developing a general kinetic model is to establish  a  
conceptual  basis  for microorganism growth description (O'Neil, Fyeratos, 1986). Therefore, the 
general dependence of the cell growth upon substrate concentration can be considered (Neubert et 
al., 1984) as a difference.
|
2.1.1.2.13
Konak has demonstrated that this equation can be reduced to a Monod kinetic (for p = 2) and to a 
Teissier kinetic (for p = 1). An attractive
dependence between Jtmax and Ks can be
written:
Because the dependence q=f(X) also involves (Yamane, 1993) a dependence upon the substrate 
concentration, there are few models which express a double influence; the most commonly being 
written as q = f(X,S).
|
The most usually kinetic models with substrate inhibition are presented below:
-  Andrews  model  (Andrews Noack), substrate inhibition in a
chemostat (Andrews, 1968):
Qmax 1 + K + S
|
Hinshelwood (Hinshelwood, 1946) detected different product inhibition influences upon the specific 
growth rate: linear decrease, exponential decrease, growth sudden stop, and linear/exponential 
decrease in comparison with a threshold value of P
|
Usually, the dissolved oxygen can be considered as a second substrate (Eiki, Osono, 1990). Hence, 
the most used equation is the kinetic model with double growth limitation, q(S,C), i.e. Olsson 
model (Moser, 1988)
|
There are simple models proposed to predict the pH effect (Ben-Hassan et al., 1991) on the process 
behavior:
-  Andreyeva   and   Biriukov (polynomial model) (Andreyeva, Biriukov, 1973)
|
In order to model the simultaneous efect of substrate concentration and pH, q = f(S,pH), there are 
different variants of the previous equations:
|
The temperature influence is introduced through  an  Arrhenius  equation  type, conforming to 
Topiwala and Sinclair model (Topiwala, Sinclair, 1971)
|
Finally, Constantinides (Constantinides et al. 1970) defines the dependence p(T,X) using the 
following equation:
The product formation kinetic is taken into account in conjunction with the growth kinetic. 
Nowadays, the Gaden classification (Gaden, 1959) is still useful. Based on this categorizing, four 
kinetic types can be defined (Moser, 1988):

Type 0: This production type occurs even in resting cells that use only a little substrate for 
their own metabolism. The microbial cells function only as enzyme carriers. Some examples  are  
provided  by  steroid transformation and vitamin E synthesis by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Type 1: Type-1 situations include processes in witch product  accumulation is directly associated 
with growth; in this case the product formation is linked to the energy metabolism. Examples 
include fermentation


Type  2.  Type-2  bioprocesses  include fermentations in which there is no direct
connection between growth and product formation  (for example,  penicillin and streptomycin 
synthesis).

Type 3. This production type includes those having a partial association with growth and thus, an 
indirect link to energy metabolism (e.g. citric acid and amino acid production)
|
When product formation is partly growth linked and partly independent of growth, a 
combination of eqs. (2.1.1.2.49) and (2.1.1.2.53) is valid, as it was proposed by Luedeking and 
Piret (Luedeking, Piret, 1959):
|
2.1.1.2.49

Kono and Asai (Kono, Asai, 1968) introduced a generalized concept, using the consumption 
coefficient G (as an apparent coefficient of growth activity)


This equation can be linked to eq. (2.1.1.2.20) which describes the specific growth rate evolution. 
Hence, the Gaden type product formations can be particularized through different values of the 
parameter kpq: kp q > 0
or kp q < 0, j' 1p 2

In special cases, different kinetic equations were proposed, according to experimental data (Shu, 
1961, Fishman, Birjukov, 1974, Ryu,
Humphrey, 1972, Brown, Vass, 1981).
|
2.1.2. Structured models

The most important structured models are correlated with the chemical cell structure. Williams  and 
 Ramkrishna  has  proposed models  with  two  components.  Williams (Williams,  1975)  has  
considered  the concentration of R-components (principally ARN) and D-components  with structural- 
genetic part (ADN and proteins). Ramkrishna (Ramkrishna, 1969) has divided the cell in G- mass (ADN 
and ARN) and D-mass (proteins). Fredrickson (Fredrickson, 1970) has analyzed later on these models 
and has demonstrated their invalidity, due to kinetic expressions which don't utilize the intrinsic 
concentrations of structural components.

A rigorous structured model involves kinetic equations, which take into account the intrinsic 
concentrations of components (i.e. the component quantity / cell unity of volume).
|
2.1.2.4

The structured models can be applied for the mixed cultures, too. In these cases, the chemical  
structure  is  substituted  with component  specie  divisions  (population models).

Harder and Roels (Harder, Roels, 1981) surveyed the biotechnology applications of simple structured 
models. Moreover, they presented the main principles of structured model design (derived from 
molecular biology):
-  The  modifications  of  substrate/ intermediate  concentrations  induce modifications of the 
reaction rates;
-  The enzyme interactions with some small molecules  generate  modifications  of enzyme 
conformation;
-  The  concentration  of  some  cell macromolecules accommodate oneself to environment conditions 
through synthesis rate modification;
-  The natural selection is an adaptation modality;
-  The environment changes can induce some modifications in respect of different species in a mixed 
culture.
|
Following these principles and according to the time relax concept, the authors proposed some 
structured models:
-  Biomass grow conforming to a bi- compartimental model;
-  Biomass grow conforming to a tri- compartimental model;
-  The synthesis of enzymes, which are genetic controlled.

Moreover, Ryu and Kim (Ryu, Kim, 1992) studied a recombinant cell bioprocess (i.e. with/without 
plasmid carrying cells).
|
2.1.3. Segregated kinetic models

The scientific literature doesn't clearly present other segregated kinetic models, except those 
using the composition based on chemical structure.

Shuler (Shuler, 1985) defines as segregated (but unstructured) models, the models based on the 
presumption that an unique variable (i.e. cell age, cell dimensions) can completely describe the 
cell state (i.e. all cells with the same age or dimensions have the same chemical  composition  and 
 the  same productive potential).

Also, Bley (Bley, 1987) proposed a specific model for yeast cells, which comprises two different 
physiological states — budding
/unbudding cells. Moreover, he proposed a model taking into consideration the yeast cells,  which  
are characterized  by two physiological states. The two states differ through  q,  dS/dt,  biomass  
production efficiency, etc. Hence, for a continuous process, in which the state transition is 
(mainly)  influenced  by  the  substrate concentration (S)
|ely).
Nowadays, the segregated and structured models are insufficiently applied. They were taken over 
from molecular biology and physiology, where they play an important role in cell mechanism 
investigations (Sonnleitner, Fiechter, 1989). For a fast increase of their applications in 
bioprocess control it is necessary:
-  To develop the non-destructive analytical techniques (Sonnleitner, 1992);
-  To link the mathematical modeling to the understanding  of  the  internal  cell mechanisms (van 
Breusegem, Bastin, 1992).
|
2.2.1. Control statement

The bioprocess control (and optimisation) strategies  are  based  on  three  main implementations 
(Pokkinen et al., 1992):
-  Algorithmic optimisation: the optimum can be analytically reached (due to relationship defined 
between process parameters);  hence,  the  algorithmic optimisation is cheaper that the adaptive 
one;
-  Adaptive  optimisation:  this  kind  of optimisation  requires  not  a  priori knowledge  
regarding  the  existing relationships   between   bioprocess parameters;
-  Intelligent  technique  optimisation: requires knowledge transfer from a human expert to the 
control structures (expert system, neural nets, fuzzy structure, etc).

Generally speaking, the first solution offers the answer based on peak parameter values estimation, 
 i.e. process optimisation  is performed in connection with a (lot of) specified parameter(s). The 
second one utilises uncomplicated kinetic models with periodical (i.e. the simple period) parameter 
adjustments. Hence, the optimum indices are continuously adjusted.

The control optimisation difficulties come from  continuous  variation  of  optimal bioprocess 
conditions, due to living cells and metabolic cycles.

The major bioprocess control difficulties are presented below (DECHEMA, 1984):

-  The impossibility to access on-line all process variables;
-  The measurements are noise influenced;
-  The process has high value of time delay;
-  The process parameters are strongly interconnected;
-  The bioprocess evolution curves are time varying  and  depend  upon  initial conditions.
|
The first obstacle till to be removed through the large-scale use of biosensors (e.g. glucose 
sensor). The standard method is based on observation schema (Nogai, 1979), which utilise secondary 
measurements. For example, it is easy to determine the RQ values (in a fed- batch bioprocess) 
through the substrate addition varying. In this case, the main problem is to fix the set-point 
value of the secondary variable in order to attempt the desired value of the primary process 
variable.

The general configuration of a bioprocess control structure is shown in fig. 2.2.1.
|
2.2.2. Performance criteria

The scientific  literature  (Moser,  1988, Richards, 1988, Trilli, 1977) recommends, from the 
bioprocess control point of view, three performance indices, which must be maximised:
-  the productivity;
-  the conversion;
-  the profit.

The productivity and the conversion rate look upon technological aspects, and the last one 
considers the economic point of view.
|
To  clarify  the  productivity  concept  (rj) (dimensions kg*m '*h ¹), the curve from the 
considering  fig.  2.2.2  can  be  used demonstrates  for discontinuous  processes. Hence, a 
certain lag time, to, is necessary between production cycles due to harvesting,
emptying and refilling operations (Moser, 1988).
|
2.2.3

The yield compares the total amount of a product j yielded from an amount of material i consumed
|
2.3.1. Bioprocess control using a priori
model

Good knowledge about physiological states and operation modes which characterize a biosystem, allow 
the design of control algorithms  dedicated  to  optimize  the bioprocess (Vanichsriratana et a/. 
1996). If this knowledge is enough for model design (i.e.  mathematical  description  of  cell 
metabolic processes), then:
-  The process mathematical description is used for the design of the control and optimization 
algorithms (Abidi et al., 1993; Isaacs, Thoma, 1992);
-  The model (based on the cellular metabolic reactions) can produce more information about the 
specificity of the applied procedure (Rohner, Meyer, 1995; Eaton, Rawlings, 1992).

A  good  mathematical  model  (i.e. comprehensive,  with  skillful  microbial kinetics integration) 
is able to give predictions relative to procedure efficiency (Moser, 1984). Moreover, it represents 
the best way for strategy design of optimal control (Slimes et al., 1995).
|
Mathematical models, which describe the living cells evolution, must represent the dynamic nature 
of the biosystem, as general as possible  (and  more  complex  as  a consequence), less empirical, 
reflecting the biochemistry of the microorganism culture. In these conditions, the model should be 
set up based on a compromise between the detailed description of the bioprocess (which means the 
use of o great number of parameters, often undeterminable/ uncontrollable) and the use of a limited 
number of parameters easy to estimate and control. (Patwardhan et al., 1992; Henson, Seborg, 1992).

As a general rule for the bioprocesses control with a priori model, the deterministic models
37
are preferred to the probabilistic ones (Cazzador, 1988). For the time being, the unstructured 
deterministic models (the cells are considered as black-box units) are very used in the bioprocess 
control. In the future an increase of the structured models role is expected, as a consequence of 
modern analysis methods development, as well as of the capacity to more adequately describe the 
phenomena.

These characteristics can be accomplished taking into account the cellular structure, at the level 
of the chemical components (chemical structured models) or from the point of view of cellular 
morphology (size, dimension and cellular age).
|
Also it is necessary to remark that the control bioprocess can be done, besides the kinetic 
equations, using the mass balance equations (Weinrich, Lapidus, 1972; Balzer et al., 1984) and the 
typical elements introduced by the bioprocess stoechiometry (yield coefficients Yxes, Yens, Yx o, 
etc.).
2.3.1.1. Main characteristics of the control with mathematical model

The development of a global model for the bioprocess evolution offers, besides the advantage of the 
analytical determination of the optimum value, the means to change the parameters during the 
process.

In these conditions, after setting up the model, the maximizing/minimizing strategy must be 
established as well as the performance index (Cardello, San, 1988; Dovi, Reverberi, 1993).

If the mathematical rules, which characterize the bioprocess, are defined, the bioprocess control 
consists of an algorithm put into operation in order to maintain the parameter evolution all around 
the optimum values. In fact this represents the simplest case for the use of a control algorithm.
|
2.3.1.6

Moreover, the access to  the information (on-line and estimative determinations) is limited 
and powerfully affected by several errors, as it has already presented.

In a recent study, Proell (Proell et al, 1994) have presented the solution of a bioprocess control 
using a priori model. He proposed the following equations:
where the values of parameters y, M, Qmax, Ki, K, and Km are obtained by estimation.

In this case the control problem comprises two levels:
-  the determination of the time minimum value at the end of the process for which the  cell  
concentration  attains  the maximum value (after this moment the process can be described as a 
stationary system);
-  the optimization of the global productivity
|

The control solution must be circumscribed to the control conditions afforded by the growth 
specific rate:
F(t + 1) = F(t) + Ke(t)        2.3.1.10

2.3.1.11


where: href '  optimal value of the specific growth rate (set-point value);
K = constant
|
In many cases, in the bioconversion process for complex chemical substance obtaining, strong 
inhibition exercised by substrate or product has been recorded.

To control such processes, it has been established, as a general rule, the use of the optimum 
domains (without inhibition) for the major bioprocess parameters.

For  the  bioprocesses  characterized  by substrate  inhibition,  the  fed-batch fermentations are 
preferred, the substrate and other products being introduced during the process, according to a 
specific protocol.

Meanwhile, for the bioprocess performance improving, the repeated fed-batch system has been used, 
which means that at the end of the process about 5-100/o of the medium volume is kept as inoculum 
for the next cycle. In these
|
In the authors' opinion, in order to modify these models into linear equivalents, it is better to 
use the nonlinear modifications of the coordinates. In this way, the fermenter productivity is 
indirectly controlled by the cell concentration,  substrate  and  metabolic product  concentrations 
 adjustment;  the obtaining results are sub-optimal.
|
The control of the bioprocesses when the cell growth and product formation take place at the same 
time, is based on the modeling with balance  equations  including  kinetic expressions. In this 
way, by solving the differential equation system, the optimum concentrations of cells and products, 
as well as the specific process rates can be determined.
|
2.3.1.3. Conceptual restrictions of the control based on a priori model

The control of the bioprocesses according to a priori model represents an optimal method, due  to  
the  possibility  of  analytical determination of the extreme values of the co- ordinates.

As it has already presented in #2.1 a great variety of analytical models can describe the culture 
evolution steps. If the parameter influence is considered, the models are able to realize a proper fit between model and experiment. 
Despite these aspects, the models mentioned in the literature can not describe accurately enough 
all the evolution steps of a complex bioprocess.

This fact is a consequence of the lack of measurement methods for on-line obtaining the variable 
levels from the system, (cf. #1.3.). On the other hand, the theoretical studies presented in the 
literature can not cover all the biological, chemical and physical phenomena taking  place  during  
micro-organism cultivation.
|
Hence, there are a great number of kinetic models, each one trying to better present the parameter 
interdependence and the bioprocess evolution. Therefore, in the future, the control structure based 
on a priori model will be replaced by more flexible configurations using the adaptive or artificial 
techniques in addition with the pr3evious control structures.
|
2.3.2. Adaptive control of bioprocesses

At the same time with the developing of the bioprocess control based on a priori model, other 
alternative  control  systems  were designed (Liu et al., 1993; Jorgensen et al., 1992). The most 
attractive was the adaptive control strategy (Ferreira, de Azevedo, 1996, Vanichsriratana et al., 
1996).
|
For instance, the following equation describes a simple growth microbial process, with a single 
substrate (with concentration S):

2.3.2.1

This relationship represents an auto-catalyzed reaction, with @g'  growth rate, X = biomass 
concentration. Note that biomass production requires an initial biomass concentration.

The enzyme-catalyzed reactions can be described as follows:

2.3.2.2

where: 9c = enzymatic catalysis rate; P = product.

The enzymatic catalysis is conceivable with a biomass, which grows on the same substrate.

An usual example for this kind of complex reaction is the yeast growth on glucose substrate. This 
bioprocess is characterized by three metabolic reactions:
-  Respiratory growth on glucose (a);
-  Fermentative growth on glucose (b);
-  Respiratory growth on ethanol (c).

(a)  S + OF   X + C

The adaptive control structures (cf. to the Belgian School Bastin, Dochain, 1990; Chen et al., 
1991), are based on the design of different estimation algorithms which are able
to determine the off-line parameter values.
(b)  S      X + E + C
(c) E + OF   X + C
|
2.3.2.3

Many control algorithms were developed based on minimal knowledge about bioprocess kinetics (i.e. 
the minimal modeling concept). Hence, the general state space model which describe the dynamics of 
bioreactors can be described as follows: the bioprocess reactions which occur in the reactor are 
assumed to be encoded  into  a reaction  network  of  M reactions involving N components (N > M).
This example (Bastin, 1992), involves three reactions with five components; O represents dissolved 
oxygen concentration, E, ethanol concentration  and C, dissolved  carbon dioxide.
|
2.3.2.12

This General Dynamical Model of biological reactors (proposed by Prof. Bastin) is the fundament of 
the control algorithms, which will be presented below.
41
Moreover, for an autocatalytic reaction, with one substrate and one gaseous product, the following 
equation can be used:
|
The design of the kinetics ‹p(\) is complex, as it depends on the following factors:
-  The adequate choice of biological and physic-chemical factors;
-  The founding of an analytical relationship for correctly describing the phenomena;
-  The determination of kinetic coefficients based on experimental data.
|
The principle of the Linear Control involves the design of a control law u(‹p, Q, f, y*), which is 
a multivariable, non-linear function. This control law must be designed so that the error (y*-y) 
respects a pre-specified nonlinear differential equation.
|
Hence, using the state variables, which are
continuously monitored (through standard instrumentation),   on-line   estimation algorithms can be 
developed and useful information will be send to the human expert.

Moreover, if an adaptive control algorithm is used, the controller must determine, at each time 
period, the best-input flow in the system
|
2.3.2.26
Conforming to these notations, the General Dynamic Model (2.3.2.6) becomes:
The coefficients Z are arbitrary selected so that the above differential equation becomes stable. 
Moreover, the reference model gets independent,  if  the  working  point  is considered.
|
The impact of intelligent techniques in the bioprocess application field represents, on one hand, a 
quasi-failure of the standard control strategy applications, and on the other hand, a pragmatic 
approach tentative in opposition with the knowledge bioprocess uncertainty.

The last equation designates the control law with exact linearization.

Conforming to author conceptions, the design of an adaptive control algorithm must focus on the 
entire bioprocess stability. Hence, two general aspects must be outlined:
a) The main objective of a fed-batch bioprocess control is to maintain the control  upon  an 
unstable  evolution trajectory; in a continuous bioprocess, the main objective is to preserve the 
global stability;
b) In a minimal modeling context (and depending on modeling strategies) the same linear controller 
design method can generate stable or unstable closed loops.

Finally, the following conclusions can be set up:
-  The  matrix  conceptualization  of bioprocess variables offers easy-to-use in control  algorithm 
 implementations (Hinde, Cooper, 1995; Meszaros, et al., 1995), but does suggest nothing about the 
corresponding real variables;
-  The optimization is made during a sample time period (Estler, 1995; Andrews, 1995); thus, it not 
corresponds to a global optimization (Harmon, et al., 1987; Modak, Lim, 1987; Modak, Lim, 1989); 
ipso facto, the control strategy is sub- optimal (Morningred et al., 1992; Modak, Lim, 1992);
-  The control structures based on these model typologies don't produce basic knowledge  about  the 
 bio/chemical mechanisms, which control the cell metabolism (Lee, Ramirez, 1996).
 |
2.3.3. Intelligent control of bioprocesses
Hence, it has been found (Narendra, Parthasarathy, 1992) that the control structures based on the 
human decisional factor (i.e. a subjectively element) offer better results as the standard control 
systems based on algorithmic determinations. Moreover,  it has been observed that a general 
stoppage exists in the bioprocess-modeling  field  (without  the structured models); so that, the 
computer performances are developed in the detriment of the general knowledge concerning life 
phenomena (Hinde, Cooper, 1994; Cooper et al., 1992). Consequently, through intelligent techniques 
(i.e. neural nets, fuzzy structures, genetic algorithms or expert systems) the uncertainties 
regarding the living phenomena can  be  mathematically  formalized. Furthermore,  the  (subjective) 
 human knowledge is used and different simulation techniques are adopted in order to find out the 
evolution types. These kind of solutions offers better results as the standard  control techniques 
but don't promote advanced comprehension upon the metabolic routes of bioprocesses.

2.3.3.1. Bioprocess control using expert systems

The development in the field of fermentation process  control  makes  necessary  the integration  
of  some  research  disciplines. Moreover, the control of biotechnological processes is based on 
the knowledge of experts and human operators as well as on analysis and processing of numerical 
data. Also, Expert Systems (ES) can handle this knowledge, acquired by human experts — but the 
specified knowledge are able to describe not more than the conscious thinking and decisions.
|
The specificity of an ES algorithm must be correlated with the functions, to be fulfilled in real 
conditions:
-  Identification of the cell population state (i.e.  on-line  evaluation  of  the physiological  
state,  cell  behavior interpretation, future state prediction and the diagnostic of biological 
phenomena);
-  Identification of the entire equipment state (i.e. fault detection);
-  Supervision of the conventional control equipment  (i.e.  set-point  values modification, 
parameter control revision, etc.);
-  Advanced communication with the human operator (i.e. parameter monitoring, etc).
|
The most used control implementation in the bioprocess field is the indirect control; two 
procedures are available:
-  The ES algorithm runs on an independent computer;  it  is  interfaced  with conventional  
controllers  (this  is, nowadays,  the  standard  control procedure);
-  The ES and the conventional control algorithms run together on the same computer; this solution 
can be the best one in the bioprocess control field.

ESDT characteristics

The usual characteristics of all applications for bioprocess control are:
-  High run speed (i.e. ESDT must be developed in Assembler and/or C);
-  Rules activation at different time period;
-  Continuous cyclic operation;
45
-  Human operator intervention relating to bioprocess evolution;
-  Integration with other external algorithms (through information exchanges);
-  Powerful  mechanism  for knowledge organization during process evolution;
-  On-line integration of new information regarding  process evolution;  inexact knowledge 
rejection (i.e. advanced control system flexibility);
-  Continuous  control  system  learning through neural nets and/or other structures.

An useful ESDT involves the following features:
-  Limiting   number   of   on-line measurable/estimable  variables  and relationships;
-  Powerful mechanisms for qualitative/ subjective information inclusion, and for confidence-level 
definition;
-  Continuous  system  supervision  (i.e. modification of time sample period, sensor periodical  
re-calibrations,  measure apparatus tests, etc).

The design of an ES for fermentation process control is based on the database and knowledge 
resources formalization, i.e. it is preferably to define a specific ESDT for each kind of 
bioprocess

2.3.3.2. Bioprocess control using neural nets

The control and optimization of a continuous stirrer tank fermenter using a neural network 
(Thibault et all., 1994) is based on the presumption that the control set-point is not known  
explicitly,  but  it  is  calculated considering the goal (through neural nets, NN) to optimize an 
objective criterion. Hence, the final results show that NN can model very accurately the bioprocess 
dynamics and can predict the state variable over a long prediction horizon.

For instance, it is assumed that the bioreactor volume remains constant and the biomass growth 
kinetics can be appropriately described

2.3.3.1

If it is desired to optimize the productivity, the value of n would be set to one. However, the 
process  economics  dictate  the  double condition to have at the same time the highest possible 
biomass productivity and a high biomass concentration. Hence, the authors resolve this conflicting 
objective by weighting accordingly both contributions to the objective function.

The authors propose a NN to be used to predict the biomass and the substrate concentrations one 
sample period in the future, being given the inlet substrate flow rate, the biomass and substrate  
concentrations at the current sampling instant. A set of 200 samples, obtained by randomly changing 
the inlet substrate flow rate was considered as the learning data set. The NN weights were obtained 
using the backpropagation algorithm in order to minimize the sum of errors squares on both biomass 
and substrate concentrations.

The results clearly demonstrates (Thibault et all., 1994) the ability of the neural model to 
indirectly represent the complex relationship occurring in the bioprocess. In addition, the NN was 
able to reproduce with an outstanding accuracy the variation of the objective function as a 
function of flow rate.

1. The literature model investigation indicates that it is impossible to design conceptual models 
conforming to Edwards & Wilke postulates. Hence, the mathematical expressions of bioprocess 
parameter evolution are built using some conceptual simplifications (e.g. the multivariable 
character of bioprocess). Moreover, a dichotomy regarding the model classes can be seen: on one 
hand, it is necessary to increase the knowledge about the cell metabolic mechanisms, and on the 
other hand, the synthetic approach is acceptable from a macroscopic point of view (i.e. for the 
control design);
2. The objective control criterion is to be made from an economic point of view, taking into 
account the (final) industrial requirements. Hence, different ways for profit determination are 
presented, linked with the bioprocess type and evolution phase.
3. The analysis of different literature methods for bioprocess control proves that it is not 
possible, in this moment, to globally optimize this kind of processes. Hence, the control with a 
priori model is not efficient due to the non-existence of global bioprocess models; the adaptive 
control strategies are (theoretically speaking) sub-optimal: the optimization during each sample 
time period cannot agree (in most cases) with the global optimum. Finally, the intelligent control 
technique solutions offer an economic answer (i.e. an increasing of efficiency) versus the 
expansion of basis knowledge regarding the process general evolution. In addition, this solution is 
based on human experience, i.e. it involves strong subjective characteristics augmented by computer 
speed.
